uicp Installation
-----------------------------

In general, uicp is automatically installed as part of a standard installation
of PHP-Qt. It may, however, be installed completely independently of PHP-Qt;
this document describes the process

Requirements:
	CMake 2.4 or newer
	Qt 4.4.0 or newer
	A C++ compiler
	
Quick install
----------------------------
cmake .;make;sudo make install

Detailed Instructions
----------------------------
	
1) Change to the top-level directory of your uicp checkout
2) Type: cmake .

You should see something like this:
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc -- works
-- Check size of void*
-- Check size of void* - done
-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++
-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works
-- Looking for Q_WS_X11
-- Looking for Q_WS_X11 - found
-- Looking for Q_WS_MAC
-- Looking for Q_WS_MAC - not found.
-- Looking for Q_WS_WIN
-- Looking for Q_WS_WIN - not found.
-- Found Qt-Version 4.4.1
-- Configuring done

If not, make sure you have Qt 4.4.0 installed and that the qmake from
Qt 4.4.0 is in your path before any other qmake binaries.

3) Type: make

You should see something like this:

wherever you like.
