* Translate more of the Qt examples to C# and fix any problems in
  Qyoto encountered.

* Write a tool in C# to introspect on the Smoke library like rbqtapi.
  (Not really necessary, you can look up all C# classes/methods with
  monop/monop2. May be useful on Windows, though)

* Write a dbusxml2cs tool based on the C++ one. This could actually be
  impossible or very difficult since the resulting C++ code makes much use of
  specific Qt casts and some macros.

* Find out what's going wrong with subclasses of QDBusAbstractAdaptor and fix
  that. Currently methods with return types like QDBusVariants create problems
  when called via D-Bus.
